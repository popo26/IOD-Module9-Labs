## Exercise 5 (Page 59)

Using the guide at https://socket.io/get-started/chat as a helper, try to implement a basic
chat app which includes one of their suggested extensions (or come up with your own!):
- Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
- Add support for nicknames.
- Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message
directly as soon as he/she presses enter.
- Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
- Show who’s online.
